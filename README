testing dot_product parralel 
dot = <x|y> = sum(x[i]*y[i], i=1..N);

dot_serial.cpp -> serial version of dot_product
dot_parallel_replicated.cpp -> parallel version with replicated arrays x y on all threads 
dot_parallel_distributed.cpp -> parralel version with x y distributed in smaller chunks over all nodes;

The arrays x, y are in the file "text.txt" which can be prepared with "utils.cpp"; 
   changing the ISEED in "utils.cpp" resequences the random generator

utils.cpp  -> prepare data files such as "data.data" containing the N, x y; copy "data.data" to "text.txt" if/as needed

----------------
io.cpp -> a testing copy ; ignore it
